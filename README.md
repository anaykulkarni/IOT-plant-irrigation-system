### An IOT-enabled plant watering system implemented using NodeMCU(ESP8266) and Blynk App.

#### This system allows you to water your garden plants using your smartphone and also keep track the soil moisture using the real-time moisture reading. Water is pumped using a 12 Volt submersible pump. The pump can be turned on/off using the app. The 'Auto Turn-Off' feature is enabled, it automatically turns off the pump when the moisture rises above a certian threshhold. The threshhold is preset to 50%.
